# This is the repository for my [Personal Project Site](https://sandstormer.github.io/).

### I am the creator of the [PokeRogue SearchDex](https://sandstormer.github.io/PokeRogue-Dex/), a fast and powerful way to search all the data in PokeRogue, with intuitive UI and advanced filtering. You can see which Pokémon learn a move and when they learn it, who has variant shinies, who has the highest stats, which biomes or eggs to find Pokémon, and much more. 

My other projects will be featured here when they are created.
