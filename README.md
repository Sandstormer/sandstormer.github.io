# This is the repository for my [Personal Project Site](https://sandstormer.github.io/).

### I am the creator of the [PokeRogue SearchDex](https://sandstormer.github.io/PokeRogue-Dex/), a fast and powerful way to search all the data in PokeRogue. 
Featuring intuitive UI and advanced filtering, you can see which Pokémon learn a move and when they learn it, who has variant shinies, who has the highest stats, which biomes or eggs to find Pokémon, and much more. You can also see the [source code](https://github.com/Sandstormer/PokeRogue-Dex).


### I also made the [PokeRogue SearchDex Updater](https://github.com/Sandstormer/PokeRogue-Updater), which assembles the data for the SearchDex.
These scripts read all the necessary data from the game code, process all the images, and put all the data into a compact format for my site. I run these scripts whenever there is a game update. There is no need for anyone else to run these, unless I am unable to continue the project.
